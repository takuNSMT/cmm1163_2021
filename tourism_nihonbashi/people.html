			<p>Many families have resided in Nihonbashi for generations. A new addition to the area is the Coredo shopping district. The combination of 3 mall districts was made in a location where many family-owned and operated businesses used to be. Instead of forcing the small businesses out all together, they all moved into the mall, even retaining the old Shinto shrines in the design. Even with the modern architectural development, the families and business they have run, in some cases for hundreds of years, are still in this downtown core of Tokyo.</p>
