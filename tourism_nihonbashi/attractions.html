			<p>We have special seasonal events all year. In spring, we have <i>Sanja Matsuri</i> festival, one of the largest Shinto festivals in the country, and thousands of locals and tourists are involved every year. <i>Mikoshi’s</i>, the sacred palanquins that transport spirits of Shinto shrines, are carried by the locals through streets and cities, and the major streets are filled with food stalls. We also have fireworks at Sumida River in summer, and a mochi (rice cake)-pounding event in winter. These are just a few examples.</p>

				<p><i>Amazake Yokochô</i>, an arcade in the Ningyocho subdivision, is packed with family-owned businesses. Amazake (a non/low-alcohol drink made from fermented rice) isn’t the only thing we have. We have green tea, rice crackers, Japanese sweets, and many more. You can even watch them being made right in front of your eyes! If that makes you hungry, you can have some snacks on the go. Check out all the restaurants and cozy cafés as well. Amazake Yokochô arcade is a great place to spend your time and relax on your slow days.</p>

			<p>Nihonbashi is also a full of historic sites. It is hard to miss the Nihonbashi Bridge if you are in the area. It is a stone bridge that was originally made with wood in the 17th century, and it is located in the middle of the Nihonbashi district. Mitsukoshi department store was constructed over a hundred years ago. The Bank of Japan Main Office is also a place to check out.
